I recently received an email from my university, The email was very plain and boring, so I decided to give it an amazing look using HTML and CSS.
The result was a much more visually appealing and engaging email that I was actually interested in reading. 
I think this is a great example of how HTML and CSS can be used to improve the design of emails.
